# Log

in this file I will attempt to detail each file that I write.

README.MD is a file that describes the set up and each other file. 

## Date: 20201119

RUn MSMC2 on different histories with various amounts of structure. Uses model instant_struct, where the final integer suffix indicates the amount of migration (divide the integer by 10). Can't remember sequence length. 


## Date: 20201120

Use the bash script 20201120_msprimejobs to practise simulating different msprime models. I ran 5 jobs, each with a different amount of migration. The log files are found in ancestry/logs.
The vcf and mhs scripts are found in ancestry/vcf_mhs. The coalescent data is stored in ancestry/coal_data .  

## Date 20201123

Within the hpc, I used the command line "$ sbatch 201123_slurm_submit.peta4-skylake" to run the bash script "ancestry/20201123_msprimejobs". This will attempt to run msprime simulations
of length 3e+9 with a constant population size history, with various levels of instantaneous migration. See the script submitted for command line details. This should write various files; 
coalescent data should be saved to /coal_data, vcfs and mhs files to /vcf_mhs.

## Date 20201124 

Submitted similar job to the above. Name of submission script was 201124_slurm_submit.peta4-skylake. Set max hours as 12. Hopefully this works. 

update as of 20201125 - job failed, exceeded time limit

## Date 20201126

Submitted two jobs to slurm, 201126_slurm_submit.peta4-skylake and 201126_slurm_submit.peta4-skylake_b. These run the files 20201126_msprimejobs_mig03_a and 20201126_msprimejobs_mig03; which each simulate structure with instantaneous migration rate as 0.1 and 0.3. 
They run 20 jobs, each on sequence length 150Mb.

update as of 20201127: these worked but something was wrong. Deleting all output, nothing kept that was written. 

## Date 20201127

Submitted job 31794200 which runs the script 20201127_msprimejobs_mig03, which runs 20 msprime simulations, of length 150MB each, of instantaneous structure. Command line (repeated 20 times) was: 
python msprime_generate.py instant_struct0001 -L 150000000 -mig 0.3 -t 20000 40000 --suffix -o_mhsdir /home/tc557/ancestry/vcf_mhs/mig03/ -o_coaldir /home/tc557/ancestry/coal_data/mig03/
Submission script was 201127_slurm_msprimemig03.
Writing to the described directories as described above.

Also submitted job 31794219 which runs the script 20201127_msprimejobs_mig01, which runs 20 msprime simulations of length 150Mb, of instantaneous structure with mig_prop = 0.1. 
Command line was : 
python msprime_generate.py instant_struct0001 -L 150000000 -mig 0.1 -t 20000 40000 --suffix -o_mhsdir /home/tc557/ancestry/vcf_mhs/mig01/ -o_coaldir /home/tc557/ancestry/coal_data/mig01
Submission script was 201127_slurm_msprimemig01.
Writes to the described directories as above.

update as of 20201127: both these jobs finished. There is a strange error I get when I try to read the vcfs to write the mhs, in the hpc. It reads the 'POS' column as pd.series, where as on my machine it reads it as an int.
Therefore writing the mhs files failed, but everything else worked fine; i.e. there are 20 coal_data files in coal_data/mig01 and coal_data/mig03; 20 vcf files in vcf_mhs/mig01 and vcf_mhs/mig03. 
Writing the mhs files from the vcf files would not be hard, simply redo the mhs script but use vcf['POS'][i].values[0] intead of vcf['POS'][i].

Submitting now a script that runs 20 msprime simulations with rate 0.2, very similar to above. Job id 31795669.
Submission script is 201127_slurm_msprimemig02, which executes the script 20201127_msprimejob_mig02. I think I fixed the mhs writing error as described above.
update: job has finished, but my previous mhs fix did not work; i.e. coal_data and vcf data written but not mhs. 
Before, I said if "tc557" in working dir, then set hpc = True, but I think the slurm scripts run from another location. 
Therefore, I Will try now changing the statement to if "trevor" not in working dir, which hopefully will do the trick. 

Submutting script 201127_slurm_msprimemig04 which will run the executable 20201127_msprimejobs_mig04, to run 20 simulations of 150MB of a structured history with 0.4 migration. 
This completed fine but again the mhs failed to write.

## Date 20201128

Submitted script 201128_slurm_msprime05 which executes 20201128_msprimejob_mig05 which is running with job number 31820379. This runs 20 simulations of 150Mb of structure with mig rate 0.5 . Will write to directories ancestry/coal_data/mig05/ and ancestry/vcf_mhs/mig05/.

In summary, today and yesterday I submitted the same 5 jobs, where there is a varying amount of instantaneous migration (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 or 0.5).
Each job used a sequence length of 150Mb, and ran 20 times. The coalalescent data for each is stored in (the hpc)  /ancestry/coal_data/mig0X , replacing X with 1 2 3 4 or 5. Similarly the vcfs are in ancestry/vcf_mhs/mig0X. TODO write the mhs files from these vcf files.  

## Date 20201130

I wrote a function to convert these into mhs. In each /mig0X folder, there should now be their corresponding multihetsep files.

## Date 20201130

I wrote 20 vcfs and mhs files that correspond to the history in MAzet 2016's Fig 3b; these are in the folder vcf_mhs/mazet2016_3b (on Surface). 
I use the python script msprime_create.py and ran this 20 times (random seed not set). I then ran MSMC2 on all of these with the command:
./MSMC2 `find /home/trevor/ancestry/vcf_mhs/mazet2016_3b/ -name "*.txt"` -o msmc_out/20201201_mazet2016_3b
which looks for all files in /home/trevor/ancestry/vcf_mhs/mazet2016_3b/ that end with .txt, and runs msmc2 on them.  

I can't seem to get MSMC2 behaving as I would expect. Creating 20 150MB multihetseps for a constant population size, to see if this works. Running `python msprime_create.py m0001 --suffix_time` and writing results to ancestry/vcf_mhs/const01


(On the HPC) run MSMC2 on all mig01 multihetseps, using the command line:
./MSMC2 `find /home/tc557/ancestry/vcf_mhs/mig01/ -name "*.txt"` -o msmc_out/mig01/mig01_all


## Date 20201203

With the MSMC output for each structured history mig01, mig02, mig03, mig04, mig05 I created a matching population size change history, see the models:
matching_mig01, matching_mig02 etc. For each of these models, I ran 20 simulations of 150MB, with the command line:
python msprime_create.py matching_mig03 -o_mhsname matching_mig03/ -o_coalname matching_mig03/ --suffix

## Date 20201204

Create new folders (on the hpc) called const_mig1 and const_mig2 in coal_data AND vcf_mhs. These are to test two scenarios of msprime models, const_mig0001 and const_mig0002.
These have constant migration followed by a mass migration. const_mig0001 uses: msprime.MassMigration(time=T_2, source =1, destination = 0, proportion = 1).   
and const_mig0002 uses: msprime.MassMigration(time=T_2, source =0, destination = 2, proportion = 1)
